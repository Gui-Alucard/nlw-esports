## Description
<br>

 - The project is called *Find your Duo*.
 - Next Level Week, also known as NLW, is a week where we develop an entire application. It is divided into two tracks, **"Explorer"** *(for those are new to programming)* and **"Ignite"** *(for those who already develop)*.
 - It is a platform to find the perfect partner to play your favorite game together, by connecting your Twitch.tv account.
